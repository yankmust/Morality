Morality
Every person makes an effort to change. However, sometimes the effort you put forth is never sufficient. If there is an emptiness within a person that needs to be filled, it is too late for some things. Morality is a game that challenges you to make ethical decisions. You will encounter people in need of your help, but you will also face the consequences of your actions. Will you show mercy and compassion, or will you be ruthless and selfish? How will your choices affect your character and the world around you?

Morality has 3 ending with cutscenes. The Good ending, The Neutral ending and The Bad ending. You can achieve these endings with your good or bad choices.
